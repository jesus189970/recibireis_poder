        <h3>Our Faith</h3>
    </div>
    <div id="all_info_container">
        <h4>We believe in God the Father</h4>
        <p>Who is the creator of the heavens and the earth. Creator of the human being. Gen.1. You alone are Jehovah, you made the heavens, and the heavens of heavens, with all his army, the earth and all that is in it, the seas and all that is in them, and you will give life all these things, and the armies of heaven worship you. Nehemiah 9:6. For in him all things were created, those in heaven and those on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, dominions, principalities, powers; Everything was created through Him and for Him. And he is before all things, and all things in him subsist. (Colossians 1:16-17)</p>
        <h4>We believe in Jesus Christ</h4>
        <p>We understand that he is the only savior of the human being. Through our faith in Him we obtain salvation and forgiveness of sins. That He was sent into the world as a servant and for the redemption of mankind. We believe in his teachings of baptism in waters, that every believer after accepting Jesus in his heart should do so publicly in the waters. Baptizing in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19). We believe that Christ is the one who baptizes in the Holy Spirit and power (Matthew 3:11). We practice the holy communion which was instructed by Jesus Himself before He was crucified. 1Cor 11:23-26, and we practice foot washing according to John 13. We know that Jesus was crucified for the sins of men and on the third day rose from the dead with indubitable proofs and is alive (Acts 1:3). We believe that Christ is the builder and founder of the church (Matthew 16:18) and that we have been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone (Ephesians 2:20,1 Corinthians 3:11). We believe in the promise that Christ would return a second time to seek His church (Acts 1:11). For the Lord Himself with the voice of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God, should descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who live, who have remained, will be caught up with them in the clouds to receive the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord (1 Thessalonians 4:16- 17).</p>
				
        <h4>We believe in the Holy Spirit</h4>
        <p>We understand that the Spirit is part of the deity of God. God the Father, God the Son. God the Holy Spirit. God has sent the Holy Spirit who is the Spirit of Jesus Christ who dwells in your hearts. Jesus himself promised us that the Father would send you the Comforter. (John 14:26). The Holy Spirit will guide us into all truth and all righteousness. (John 16:13-15) We believe in the spillover of the E.S. Like speaking in different languages. (Acts 2) The manifestation of the gifts of the Spirit (1 Corinthians 12.) We understand that every believer must have the fruit of the Spirit which is Love, Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Goodness, Faith, Gentleness, Self- Control .(Galatians 5:22-23). We believe that once the Spirit dwells in the person there will be a complete purification from the inside out a complete transformation of being, spirit, soul and body. (1Thess 5:23). This progressive sanctification will lead us to be the different from the world. We will be the light that illuminates
				the darkness. We believe that the Church of the Lord cannot be seen like those of the world and must maintain a constant life of prayer and fasting in order to overcome the forces of evil and live a life consecrated in integrity and obedience to the Lord Jesus Christ. (Matthew 26:41,1 Thessalonians 5:17, Matthew 17:21).</p>
        <h4>We believe in God's word</h4>
        <p>The Bible, which was inspired by God written by men chosen and inspired by the Holy Spirit. We understand that the whole word is inspired by God and useful for teaching, for rebuking, for correction, for instructing in righteousness, so that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly prepared for every good work. (2Tim. 3:16- 17). The word of God is our guide is our light and light. We believe that the word of God is the truth because Christ said, Father, sanctify them in your truth; Your word is the truth. (John 17:17) Through it we receive sanctification, and through it we are in truth. We understand that what is written and prophesied in it will be fulfilled.
