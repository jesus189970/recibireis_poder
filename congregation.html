            <p>The Pentecostal Church Receive Power Inc. was born as follow. Years ago, we received the calling to go out into pastoral ministry which was also confirmed by our Pastor at that time. We were dismissed from that congregation along with my wife and three children. From that moment we began to pray to the Lord that He would show us the place where we would open a new church. One night the Lord reveals himself to us in vision and declares to us a name of a city that is called Phillipsburg NJ. That night I heard a voice telling me Phillipsburg, Phillipsburg.. Phillipsburg.. and then I understood that it was the voice of God telling me that the place for the church will be in Phillipsburg NJ.</p>
						
            <p>After that wonderful experience with the Lord we came left to fulfill the call that God had made to us. We walked in faith without knowing this city where God had sent us. We began to evangelize this city and after two weeks we managed to get a Baptist Temple on Main St. Our first service would take place Sunday, November 16, 2008. From that moment until today God has opened great doors for us in this city where we managed to buy our own place in 2016 to God be the glory. Where now we have a beautiful congregation that the Lord has allowed us pastor. With powerful leaders, men, women and youth filled with the power of the Holy Spirit and a burning desire to do God's will.</p>

            <p>
                We have seen so many wonders in this city and surrounding cities. Reaching out to the needy and lost souls. We have witnessed God's power even in these difficult and violent times. And although great oppositions and challenges await us, God has promised us a great harvest and victories. Because the one God calls he will always uphold. To Him always the glory.
